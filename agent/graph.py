Deep Agent graph.

State: messages (append-only), todos (last-write wins), vfs_keys (last-write wins).
Checkpointer: AsyncPostgresSaver — full conversation history survives server restarts,
              supports async streaming via astream_events.

build_agent() is async and must be called from an async context (e.g. FastAPI lifespan).
For sync/CLI use, see the README for the sync PostgresSaver alternative.

1. Call write_todos with your full plan before starting any work.
2. Use write_file to store large artifacts (code, reports, data). Never put file *content* in your response — only paths.
3. Use bash_execute to run scripts. Files you wrote with write_file are available in the working directory.
4. Use the skill tools (analyze_data, write_code, search_knowledge) for specialised LLM work.
5. Call request_options when you need a human decision before proceeding.
6. When done, summarize what was accomplished and list the VFS paths of any artifacts.

Keep your reasoning concise. Prefer tools over inline content."""
